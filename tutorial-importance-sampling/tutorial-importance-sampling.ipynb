    "# Tutorial 1: Modeling and Basic Importance Sampling Inference\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial shows how to write a probabilistic model in Gen, and how to implement a simple inference algorithm for this model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, will implement an inference algorithm that infers the probable destination of an autonomous agent from its observed motion in a two-dimensional environment with obstacles. The algorithm will employ a generative model that includes (i) a prior distribution on the destination of the agent, and (ii) an algorithmic model for how the agent plans its movement based on its destination, (iii) a statistical model of the noise in our measurements of the agent's motion. This class of model draws inspiration from models of human cognition from the computational cognitive science literature [1]. We use this model because the results of inference are intuitive from everyday life and are straightforward to visualize.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will break down this modeling and inference tasks into the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Step 1:** Implement geometric primitives for a two-dimensional scene that contains obstacles.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Step 2:** Implement a planning algorithm that takes the two-dimensional scene, and a starting point within the scene, and a destination point within the scene, and generates an efficient (short) path from the starting point to the destination point.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Step 3:** Write a generative function for the observed motion of of an autonomous agent, using the Julia code written in Steps 1 and 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Step 4:** Explore the the assumptions, or prior beliefs, that our inferences will be based on, by sampling traces of the generative function.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Step 5:** Use a simple importance sampling algorithm to sample probable destination points for the agent, given an example data set of observed motion.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Step 6:** Peek under the hood of the inference algorithm to build some intuition for how it works. \n",
